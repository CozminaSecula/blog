**Key drivers for customer loyalty**:
:::

::: smallest
-   **Improve Weakness**: The correlation to customer loyalty is 0.49, and customer satisfaction is low (dissatisfied and very dissatisfied). In the lower right quadrant of the key driver analysis chart, customer satisfaction with the salesperson competency "has a recommendation" is 19%, and with the salesperson competency "understanding your needs" is 18%. On the upper side of this quadrant, it is essential to note the significant percentage of neutral responses for these two questions.

-   **Leverage Great**: The correlation to customer loyalty is 0.49, and customer satisfaction is high (satisfied and very satisfied). In the upper right quadrant, customer satisfaction with salesperson competency "has a recommendation” is 50%, and with salesperson competency "understanding your needs” is 49%.

-   **Disregard**: The remaining survey questions have a mix of positive and negative customer responses. However, they are not as important for customer loyalty as the other two questions.

**Recommendation**
:::

::: smallest
To improve customer loyalty, the company could consider:

-   Improving salespeople’s ability to understand customer needs. This may include active listening, asking relevant questions, and maintaining accurate records.

-   Providing training for sales staff on making informed recommendations. This would likely result in a positive return on investment.

-   Identifying employees skilled at understanding and advising customers from raw data and sharing these skills within the team could also be beneficial.

-   Learning more about clients who declare themselves neutral and how to convert them into satisfied customers.
