</ul>
</li>
</ul></section></section><section id="conclusion" class="level1"><h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this project, I aimed to analyze compensation differences based on variables such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups. By analyzing employee data, companies can identify learning opportunities backed by evidence. This information can then be used to develop a more competitive compensation strategy, which can have various benefits, such as attracting and retaining high-performing employees, boosting employee morale and motivation, and ultimately contributing to the success of the business.</p>

<span id="cb59-975"><a href="#cb59-975" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In this project, I aimed to analyze compensation differences based on variables such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups. By analyzing employee data, companies can identify learning opportunities backed by evidence. This information can then be used to develop a more competitive compensation strategy, which can have various benefits, such as attracting and retaining high-performing employees, boosting employee morale and motivation, and ultimately contributing to the success of the business.</span>
