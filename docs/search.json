To address this problem, researchers advise organizations to look beyond statistical data and investigate the underlying causes of employees’ low perception of well-being.\nThis study aims to explore the work environment factors and managers’ behaviors that employees perceive as influencing their well-being at work and how they perceive them.\nFollowing a qualitative research design, data were collected cross-sectionally using semi-structured interviews involving 11 employees from various occupations, organizations, and industries. A template analysis strategy was used for data analysis.\nThe findings reveal a variety of job resources and demands that influence well-being at work. Factors such as social support at work, autonomy and flexibility in work, opportunities for professional development, and relevant feedback were all perceived by participants as positively influencing their well-being. On the other hand, dealing with the unpredictability and overload of multiple tasks and ambiguity at work negatively affected their well-being. Furthermore, the findings show that certain managerial behaviors can promote or negatively impact employee well-being. Managers’ behaviors that promote employee well-being include, for example, demonstrating appreciation and recognition at work, showing responsiveness, and providing support and clarity. Lack of responsiveness, excessive control over participants’ work, and failure to allocate resources or manage workloads were perceived as impediments to workplace well-being.\nThis study suggests that organizations can adopt the Job Demand-Resource Model to identify the specific job resources and demands that influence employee well-being. This can lead to more effective interventions addressing these factors and increase overall employee well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Presentation"

    "text": "A people analytics project typically involves working with quantifiable data to address business questions and objectives. However, for data to be valuable, it requires analysis and interpretation, which is where analytic techniques become critical. This post introduces two distinct tools for initiating data analysis with categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\nFrequency tables serve as a statistical instrument for categorical data analysis. They achieve this by counting the occurrences of variables within a data set, providing a concise overview of the distribution and patterns within these categorical variables. When analyzing categorical data, it is often essential to determine if a significant relationship exists between two categorical variables within data set. The chi-squared test helps determine whether these two variables are associated or functionally related. In simpler terms, it quantifies the degree of independence between two categorical variables. When employed together, these tools can unveil intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nIn this post, I will guide you through the utilization of frequency tables and the chi-squared test for insightful data analysis."

    "section": "What is a frequency table?",
    "text": "What is a frequency table?\nThe simplest way to summarize data for individual variables is to present them in a table, which displays specific amounts. In the case of categorical data, the table provides a summary of the number of cases (frequencies) in each category. This is known as a frequency table and is used when you want to summarize data for a single variable.\nHowever, when you want to examine the relationship between two variables simultaneously, you can use a different type of table called a contingency table or cross-tab. This table does a cross-tabulation of the frequency of occurrence for each category of interest. For example, when working with survey data, frequency tables can be very useful for gaining insights into the distribution and patterns of categorical variables."

    "text": "Applying Chi-Squared Test\nThe procedure for assessing the presence of a significant difference between variables involves the following steps:\n\nFormulate the Hypotheses: The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that there’s no association between the variables (i.e., they are independent). The alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that there is an association.\nCalculate Expected Values: For each cell in the table, calculate the expected frequency if H0 is true. This is done by multiplying the row total and column total for that cell and dividing by the overall total.\nCompute Chi-Squared Statistic: For each cell, subtract the expected frequency from the observed frequency, square the result, and divide by the expected frequency. Sum these values for all cells to get the Chi-Squared statistic.\nDetermine Degrees of Freedom: This is typically calculated as (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1).\nCompute P-value: Using the Chi-Squared statistic and degrees of freedom, compute the P-value from a Chi-Squared distribution table.\nInterpret Result (determine statistical significance): If the P-value is less than your chosen significance level (often 0.05), reject H0 and conclude that there is a significant association between the variables."

For instance, the “clerical_officer” role comprises 80% females and 20% males, whereas the “partner” role is represented by nearly 90% males and just over 10% females. Up to this point, data reveal an observable pattern, men are more prevalent in senior roles and women predominantly occupy junior roles. However, it is not completely obvious just from looking at the data whether the company experiences a diversity and inclusion issue or if this is just due to chance. The next step involves conducting a statistical analysis to determine the significance of this pattern.

Since the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the two variables are dependent.\nThis result indicates a statistically significant association between gender and job grade. It suggests that certain factors are influencing the observed distribution of genders within job grades.\nFurther analysis is needed to investigate whether these factors may involve forms of discrimination."
