    "text": "Abstract\nEmployee well-being is essential for both individuals and organizations.\nDespite large investments by organizations in improving employee well-being, research has shown a deterioration over time. To address this problem, researchers advise organizations to look beyond statistical data and investigate the underlying causes of employees’ low perception of well-being.\nThis study aims to explore the work environment factors and managers’ behaviors that employees perceive as influencing their well-being at work and how they perceive them.\nFollowing a qualitative research design, data were collected cross-sectionally using semi-structured interviews involving 11 employees from various occupations, organizations, and industries. A template analysis strategy was used for data analysis.\nThe findings reveal a variety of job resources and demands that influence well-being at work. Factors such as social support at work, autonomy and flexibility in work, opportunities for professional development, and relevant feedback were all perceived by participants as positively influencing their well-being. On the other hand, dealing with the unpredictability and overload of multiple tasks and ambiguity at work negatively affected their well-being. Furthermore, the findings show that certain managerial behaviors can promote or negatively impact employee well-being. Managers’ behaviors that promote employee well-being include, for example, demonstrating appreciation and recognition at work, showing responsiveness, and providing support and clarity. Lack of responsiveness, excessive control over participants’ work, and failure to allocate resources or manage workloads were perceived as impediments to workplace well-being.\nThis study suggests that organizations can adopt the Job Demand-Resource Model to identify the specific job resources and demands that influence employee well-being. This can lead to more effective interventions addressing these factors and increase overall employee well-being."

    "text": "Step 1 : determine stakeholder requirements\nDetermining stakeholder requirements is essential for the success of any HR research and analytics initiative. It involves establishing a partnership with key stakeholders, such as executives, line managers, senior HR leaders, HR business partners, employees, and technology vendors. Each stakeholder has a different perspective and set of concerns regarding HR analytics practices and activities. While line managers primarily focus on data visualization and reporting of key metrics and analytical insights, executives and senior HR leaders are more concerned with how HR analytics supports HR strategy, execution, workforce decisions, and overall business outcomes. Leading HR analytics in organizations has an important role in assisting stakeholders with framing realistic, measurable, value-added, evidence-based, and ethical questions. This helps formulate and frame HR research and analytics questions, identify strategic and tactical priorities, secure stakeholder commitment, and provide communication on the ongoing progress of key HR research and analytics initiatives.\nDuring this step, many questions are likely to arise.\n\n“There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question”.\nCarl Sagan2"

Primary research addresses specific questions and can be done in-house or in collaboration with universities.\nSecondary research provides data from existing sources, such as scientific studies, reports from credible institutes, HR benchmarking, labor market databases.\nTheory-driven (deductive) and data-driven (inductive) approaches to mining and modeling data from the organization’s HRIS, SaaS-based platforms (e.g. data aggregation and visualization products, employee engagement tools, social or organizational network technologies) and other external data sources are another way to gather, query and analyze data about the workforce, provided it is done ethically and responsibility."

While software firms like Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, SAS, and Workday have integrated HR analytical capabilities into their products, they cannot magically interpret all the “Big Data” available. HR strategy often involves manual work by qualified researchers, analysts, and data scientists. To improve analytical capabilities, it is suggested that organizations start small and build their HR analytical capabilities over time. Meta-analysis (i.e. an analysis of analysis) is a practical approach to explore and understand multiple data sources in relation to each other, enabling organizations to understand workforce insights.\nFor example:\n\nTo what extent are the results from individual 360-degree assessments consistent with your employee survey data, exit survey data, or actual turnover?\nAre high-potential, emerging leaders leaving the organization for the same reasons year over year (e.g. little to no advancement and promotion opportunities, few organizational leadership opportunities, lack of decision rights, low base pay relative to the market)?\n\nPerforming a meta-analysis enables you to answer these questions and, more importantly, codify and make sense of disparate data sources to collect critical workforce insights.\nPerforming the meta-analysis can be simple or complex. This largely depends on the nature of the data gathered, sophistication and competency of the HR researcher, analyst or data scientist and the amount of resources and time to conduct the analysis."

    "text": "Step 6 : communicate intelligence results\nThe sixth step of the HR analytics cycle involves communicating intelligence results through storytelling.\nThis approach can be powerful in presenting data-driven insights. The story’s veracity and the ethicality of data-driven insights must be considered. Inaccurate or misleading insights can lead to bad workforce decisions and organizational consequences. Hence, communicating and reporting HR analytical insights involves not only some ethical interpretation on the part of the HR analytics team but also speaking truth to power.\nAdvances have been made in linking HR to business strategy and performance through the use of balanced scorecards, HR scorecards, and workforce scorecards. While, not all data can be expressed in simple metrics, scorecards and dashboards are effective tools for communicating strategic metrics and are best used as communication and reporting tools for strategy execution once an agreed-upon strategy is in place."

Scientific Method Utilization\n\nIf you are not sure where to focus your analysis or what data to collect, start with a theory and hypothesis.\n\nStart by being curious, observe, create a theory and hypothesis, collect data, test your hypothesis, and refine your approach based on the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author suggests to try:\n\n\n\n\nBe curious about something – Why are younger employees leaving at a different rate compared to older employees?\nObserve – They are leaving at X rate, vs older talent at Y rate.\nHave a theory – For example, consider if a lack of inclusion is causing disengagement.\nMake a hypothesis – Think about something you can see, like if people are being interrupted in meetings. This could make them feel excluded and more likely to leave.\nCollect data – Keep a record of interruptions or speaking time in meetings.\nTest hypotheses – See if the data shows that being interrupted is connected to leaving. Look for evidence supporting your theory.\nRevise theory and repeat – If your theory is right, and you find consistent evidence, you can make changes or policies based on this. If not, you might need to explore other ideas and refine your theory."

    "text": "What is problem definition?\nProblem definition is a process of articulating a specific and actionable problem and identifying the root cause of that problem by using data, research, and collaboration.\n\nCreating a problem definition in 4 steps\n1. From issue to problem\n\nWrite down the issue you are trying to solve in a few lines. When you start, the issue is likely to be very broad.\nArticulate the problem. Write a one-paragraph problem definition. It should address the basics, including:\n\nWhat is the problem?\nWhen does it occur?\nWhere does it occur?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nTake care that the problem is not a solution in disguise.\nAvoid complex jargon and technical terms when you write.\nReviewing the problem definition is a group collaborative exercise.\n\n\n\n2. Articulating root causes\n\nWhy do we think this problem is happening? Write down all possible causes.\n5X WHY - Root cause analysis:\n\nMake a list of whys (at least five) that describe why the problem is happening.\nAsk why those problems are happening.\nRepeat the exercise. Five times.\nDevelop a hypothesis for the most likely causes.\nRepeat five times to create a likely list.\nPrioritize those problems that are solvable by working with others.\n\n\n3. Identifying those most affected\n\nWrite down a list of those who are most affected by the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAvoid generic statements like “people” in favor of a specific description of those immediately impacted.\n\n\n\nThose affected may be the organization, people, or both.\nPeople may be affected at certain points in their employee lifetime, such as onboarding, development, or retention.\nIdentify the people affected and invite them to review the problem definition.\n\n4. Reframing the problem\n\nLASSO framework:\n\nL - LIMITED. Have I limited the scope? Have I narrowed a large problem down to a more readily definable smaller problem?\nA - ACTIONABLE. Have I described something actionable that we can realistically do something about?\nS - SPECIFIC. Have I described something specific, concrete, or detailed?\nS - SUPPORTED. Have I described a problem that will be supported? My organization cares enough about the problem to take action and invest in the evaluation process to determine whether the solution will work.\nO - OWNER. Have I identified the problem owner? Someone needs to be on point to manage the process and communicate back to stakeholders."

However, for data to be valuable, it requires analysis and interpretation, which is where analytic techniques become critical. This post introduces two distinct tools for initiating data analysis with categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\nFrequency tables serve as a statistical instrument for categorical data analysis. They achieve this by counting the occurrences of variables within a data set, providing a concise overview of the distribution and patterns within these categorical variables. When analyzing categorical data, it is often essential to determine if a significant relationship exists between two categorical variables within data set. The chi-squared test helps determine whether these two variables are associated or functionally related. In simpler terms, it quantifies the degree of independence between two categorical variables. When employed together, these tools can unveil intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nThe slides will guide you through the utilization of frequency tables and the chi-squared test for insightful data analysis.\n\n\nSlides"

It may include essential metrics such as the total number of values, the mean value, and the standard deviation. These statistics provide a clear picture of data trends and distribution, aiding in the interpretation of data patterns. On the other hand, the independent-samples t-test (part of inferential statistics) is employed to compare means between two distinct groups. It helps us investigate whether these two groups differ significantly in a particular dimension. When used together, these tools can reveal intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nThe presentation will guide you through the utilization of summary statistics and the independent-samples t-test for insightful data analysis.\n\n\nPresentation"

However, I encountered a challenge: how can I effectively display different visual data in one place, such as a dashboard? I needed a tool to simplify data presentation while allowing for tailored content. That’s when I discovered Quarto Dashboards, a recent addition to Quarto. This feature allowed me to create a custom dashboard using R, complete with personalized colors and styles. In the following sections, I will share how I created the dashboard.\nYou can find the finished dashboard here:\nThe code for the dashboard can be accessed on GitHub."
