    "text": "Step 1 : determine stakeholder requirements\nDetermining stakeholder requirements is essential for the success of any HR research and analytics initiative. It involves establishing a partnership with key stakeholders, such as executives, line managers, senior HR leaders, HR business partners, employees, and technology vendors. Each stakeholder has a different perspective and set of concerns regarding HR analytics practices and activities. While line managers primarily focus on data visualization and reporting of key metrics and analytical insights, executives and senior HR leaders are more concerned with how HR analytics supports HR strategy, execution, workforce decisions, and overall business outcomes. Leading HR analytics in organizations has an important role in assisting stakeholders with framing realistic, measurable, value-added, evidence-based, and ethical questions. This helps formulate and frame HR research and analytics questions, identify strategic and tactical priorities, secure stakeholder commitment, and provide communication on the ongoing progress of key HR research and analytics initiatives.\nDuring this step, many questions are likely to arise.\n\n“There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question”.\nCarl Sagan2"

While software firms like Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, SAS, and Workday have integrated HR analytical capabilities into their products, they cannot magically interpret all the “Big Data” available. HR strategy often involves manual work by qualified researchers, analysts, and data scientists. To improve analytical capabilities, it is suggested that organizations start small and build their HR analytical capabilities over time. Meta-analysis (i.e. an analysis of analysis) is a practical approach to explore and understand multiple data sources in relation to each other, enabling organizations to understand workforce insights.\nFor example:\n\nTo what extent are the results from individual 360-degree assessments consistent with your employee survey data, exit survey data, or actual turnover?\nAre high-potential, emerging leaders leaving the organization for the same reasons year over year (e.g. little to no advancement and promotion opportunities, few organizational leadership opportunities, lack of decision rights, low base pay relative to the market)?\n\nPerforming a meta-analysis enables you to answer these questions and, more importantly, codify and make sense of disparate data sources to collect critical workforce insights.\nPerforming the meta-analysis can be simple or complex. This largely depends on the nature of the data gathered, sophistication and competency of the HR researcher, analyst or data scientist and the amount of resources and time to conduct the analysis."

The story’s veracity and the ethicality of data-driven insights must be considered. Inaccurate or misleading insights can lead to bad workforce decisions and organizational consequences. Hence, communicating and reporting HR analytical insights involves not only some ethical interpretation on the part of the HR analytics team but also speaking truth to power.\nAdvances have been made in linking HR to business strategy and performance through the use of balanced scorecards, HR scorecards, and workforce scorecards. While, not all data can be expressed in simple metrics, scorecards and dashboards are effective tools for communicating strategic metrics and are best used as communication and reporting tools for strategy execution once an agreed-upon strategy is in place."

Scientific Method Utilization\n\nIf you are not sure where to focus your analysis or what data to collect, start with a theory and hypothesis.\n\nStart by being curious, observe, create a theory and hypothesis, collect data, test your hypothesis, and refine your approach based on the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author suggests to try:\n\n\n\n\nBe curious about something – Why are younger employees leaving at a different rate compared to older employees?\nObserve – They are leaving at X rate, vs older talent at Y rate.\nHave a theory – For example, consider if a lack of inclusion is causing disengagement.\nMake a hypothesis – Think about something you can see, like if people are being interrupted in meetings. This could make them feel excluded and more likely to leave.\nCollect data – Keep a record of interruptions or speaking time in meetings.\nTest hypotheses – See if the data shows that being interrupted is connected to leaving. Look for evidence supporting your theory.\nRevise theory and repeat – If your theory is right, and you find consistent evidence, you can make changes or policies based on this. If not, you might need to explore other ideas and refine your theory."

    "text": "What is problem definition?\nProblem definition is a process of articulating a specific and actionable problem and identifying the root cause of that problem by using data, research, and collaboration.\n\nCreating a problem definition in 4 steps\n1. From issue to problem\n\nWrite down the issue you are trying to solve in a few lines. When you start, the issue is likely to be very broad.\nArticulate the problem. Write a one-paragraph problem definition. It should address the basics, including:\n\nWhat is the problem?\nWhen does it occur?\nWhere does it occur?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nTake care that the problem is not a solution in disguise.\nAvoid complex jargon and technical terms when you write.\nReviewing the problem definition is a group collaborative exercise.\n\n\n\n2. Articulating root causes\n\nWhy do we think this problem is happening? Write down all possible causes.\n5X WHY - Root cause analysis:\n\nMake a list of whys (at least five) that describe why the problem is happening.\nAsk why those problems are happening.\nRepeat the exercise. Five times.\nDevelop a hypothesis for the most likely causes.\nRepeat five times to create a likely list.\nPrioritize those problems that are solvable by working with others.\n\n\n3. Identifying those most affected\n\nWrite down a list of those who are most affected by the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAvoid generic statements like “people” in favor of a specific description of those immediately impacted.\n\n\n\nThose affected may be the organization, people, or both.\nPeople may be affected at certain points in their employee lifetime, such as onboarding, development, or retention.\nIdentify the people affected and invite them to review the problem definition.\n\n4. Reframing the problem\n\nLASSO framework:\n\nL - LIMITED. Have I limited the scope? Have I narrowed a large problem down to a more readily definable smaller problem?\nA - ACTIONABLE. Have I described something actionable that we can realistically do something about?\nS - SPECIFIC. Have I described something specific, concrete, or detailed?\nS - SUPPORTED. Have I described a problem that will be supported? My organization cares enough about the problem to take action and invest in the evaluation process to determine whether the solution will work.\nO - OWNER. Have I identified the problem owner? Someone needs to be on point to manage the process and communicate back to stakeholders."
