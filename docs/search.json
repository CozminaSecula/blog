    "text": "What is problem definition?\nProblem definition is a process of articulating a specific and actionable problem and identifying the root cause of that problem by using data, research, and collaboration.\n\nCreating a problem definition in 4 steps\n1. From issue to problem\n\nWrite down the issue you are trying to solve in a few lines. When you start, the issue is likely to be very broad.\nArticulate the problem. Write a one-paragraph problem definition. It should address the basics, including:\n\nWhat is the problem?\nWhen does it occur?\nWhere does it occur?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nTake care that the problem is not a solution in disguise.\nAvoid complex jargon and technical terms when you write.\nReviewing the problem definition is a group collaborative exercise.\n\n\n\n2. Articulating root causes\n\nWhy do we think this problem is happening? Write down all possible causes.\n5X WHY - Root cause analysis:\n\nMake a list of whys (at least five) that describe why the problem is happening.\nAsk why those problems are happening.\nRepeat the exercise. Five times.\nDevelop a hypothesis for the most likely causes.\nRepeat five times to create a likely list.\nPrioritize those problems that are solvable by working with others.\n\n\n3. Identifying those most affected\n\nWrite down a list of those who are most affected by the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAvoid generic statements like “people” in favor of a specific description of those immediately impacted.\n\n\n\nThose affected may be the organization, people, or both.\nPeople may be affected at certain points in their employee lifetime, such as onboarding, development, or retention.\nIdentify the people affected and invite them to review the problem definition.\n\n4. Reframing the problem\n\nLASSO framework:\n\nL - LIMITED. Have I limited the scope? Have I narrowed a large problem down to a more readily definable smaller problem?\nA - ACTIONABLE. Have I described something actionable that we can realistically do something about?\nS - SPECIFIC. Have I described something specific, concrete, or detailed?\nS - SUPPORTED. Have I described a problem that will be supported? My organization cares enough about the problem to take action and invest in the evaluation process to determine whether the solution will work.\nO - OWNER. Have I identified the problem owner? Someone needs to be on point to manage the process and communicate back to stakeholders."

This could make them feel excluded and more likely to leave.\nCollect data – Keep a record of interruptions or speaking time in meetings.\nTest hypotheses – See if the data shows that being interrupted is connected to leaving. Look for evidence supporting your theory.\nRevise theory and repeat – If your theory is right, and you find consistent evidence, you can make changes or policies based on this. If not, you might need to explore other ideas and refine your theory."

However, for data to be valuable, it requires analysis and interpretation, which is where analytic techniques become critical. This presentation introduces two distinct tools for initiating data analysis with categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\nFrequency tables serve as a statistical instrument for categorical data analysis. They achieve this by counting the occurrences of variables within a data set, providing a concise overview of the distribution and patterns within these categorical variables. When analyzing categorical data, it is often essential to determine if a significant relationship exists between two categorical variables within data set. The chi-squared test helps determine whether these two variables are associated or functionally related. In simpler terms, it quantifies the degree of independence between two categorical variables. When employed together, these tools can unveil intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nThe presentation will guide you through the utilization of frequency tables and the chi-squared test for insightful data analysis.\n\n\nPresentation"

It may include essential metrics such as the total number of values, the mean value, and the standard deviation. These statistics provide a clear picture of data trends and distribution, aiding in the interpretation of data patterns. On the other hand, the independent-samples t-test (part of inferential statistics) is employed to compare means between two distinct groups. It helps us investigate whether these two groups differ significantly in a particular dimension.
