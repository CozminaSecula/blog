    "text": "Employee well-being is essential for both individuals and organizations.\nDespite large investments by organizations in improving employee well-being, research has shown a deterioration over time. To address this problem, researchers advise organizations to look beyond statistical data and investigate the underlying causes of employees’ low perception of well-being.\nThis study aims to explore the work environment factors and managers’ behaviors that employees perceive as influencing their well-being at work and how they perceive them.\nFollowing a qualitative research design, data were collected cross-sectionally using semi-structured interviews involving 11 employees from various occupations, organizations, and industries. A template analysis strategy was used for data analysis.\nThe findings reveal a variety of job resources and demands that influence well-being at work. Factors such as social support at work, autonomy and flexibility in work, opportunities for professional development, and relevant feedback were all perceived by participants as positively influencing their well-being. On the other hand, dealing with the unpredictability and overload of multiple tasks and ambiguity at work negatively affected their well-being. Furthermore, the findings show that certain managerial behaviors can promote or negatively impact employee well-being. Managers’ behaviors that promote employee well-being include, for example, demonstrating appreciation and recognition at work, showing responsiveness, and providing support and clarity. Lack of responsiveness, excessive control over participants’ work, and failure to allocate resources or manage workloads were perceived as impediments to workplace well-being.\nThis study suggests that organizations can adopt the Job Demand-Resource Model to identify the specific job resources and demands that influence employee well-being. This can lead to more effective interventions addressing these factors and increase overall employee well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Presentation"

    "text": "Introduction\nA people analytics project typically involves working with quantifiable data to address business questions and objectives. However, for data to be valuable, it requires analysis and interpretation, which is where analytic techniques become critical. This presentation introduces two distinct tools for initiating data analysis with categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\nFrequency tables serve as a statistical instrument for categorical data analysis. They achieve this by counting the occurrences of variables within a data set, providing a concise overview of the distribution and patterns within these categorical variables. When analyzing categorical data, it is often essential to determine if a significant relationship exists between two categorical variables within data set. The chi-squared test helps determine whether these two variables are associated or functionally related. In simpler terms, it quantifies the degree of independence between two categorical variables. When employed together, these tools can unveil intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nThe presentation will guide you through the utilization of frequency tables and the chi-squared test for insightful data analysis.\n\n\nSlides"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the previous post, I introduced two fundamental concepts to analyze categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\nThis post goes one step further by offering two tools for data analysis, which will work with continuous and categorical data: summary statistics and the independent samples t-test.\nAs part of descriptive statistics, summary statistics can provide valuable insights into data sets. It may include essential metrics such as the total number of values, the mean value, and the standard deviation. These statistics provide a clear picture of data trends and distribution, aiding in the interpretation of data patterns. On the other hand, the independent-samples t-test is employed to compare means between two distinct groups. It helps us investigate whether these two groups differ significantly in a particular dimension. When used together, these tools can reveal intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nThe presentation will guide you through the utilization of summary statistics and the independent-samples t-test for insightful data analysis.\n\n\nSlides"
