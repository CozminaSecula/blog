    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nA people analytics project typically involves working with quantifiable data to address business questions and objectives. However, for data to be valuable, it requires analysis and interpretation, which is where analytic techniques become critical. This presentation introduces two distinct tools for initiating data analysis with categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\nFrequency tables serve as a statistical instrument for categorical data analysis. They achieve this by counting the occurrences of variables within a data set, providing a concise overview of the distribution and patterns within these categorical variables. When analyzing categorical data, it is often essential to determine if a significant relationship exists between two categorical variables within data set. The chi-squared test helps determine whether these two variables are associated or functionally related. In simpler terms, it quantifies the degree of independence between two categorical variables. When employed together, these tools can unveil intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nThe presentation will guide you through the utilization of frequency tables and the chi-squared test for insightful data analysis.\n\n\nSlides"

    "text": "Introduction\nIn the previous post, I introduced two fundamental concepts to analyze categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\nThis post goes one step further by offering two tools for data analysis, which will work with continuous and categorical data: summary statistics and the independent samples t-test.\nAs part of descriptive statistics, summary statistics can provide valuable insights into data sets. It may include essential metrics such as the total number of values, the mean value, and the standard deviation. These statistics provide a clear picture of data trends and distribution, aiding in the interpretation of data patterns. On the other hand, the independent-samples t-test is employed to compare means between two distinct groups. It helps us investigate whether these two groups differ significantly in a particular dimension. When used together, these tools can reveal intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\nThe presentation will guide you through the utilization of summary statistics and the independent-samples t-test for insightful data analysis.\n\n\nSlides"

    "text": "Employee well-being is essential for both individuals and organizations.\nDespite large investments by organizations in improving employee well-being, research has shown a deterioration over time. To address this problem, researchers advise organizations to look beyond statistical data and investigate the underlying causes of employees’ low perception of well-being.\nThis study aims to explore the work environment factors and managers’ behaviors that employees perceive as influencing their well-being at work and how they perceive them.\nFollowing a qualitative research design, data were collected cross-sectionally using semi-structured interviews involving 11 employees from various occupations, organizations, and industries. A template analysis strategy was used for data analysis.\nThe findings reveal a variety of job resources and demands that influence well-being at work. Factors such as social support at work, autonomy and flexibility in work, opportunities for professional development, and relevant feedback were all perceived by participants as positively influencing their well-being. On the other hand, dealing with the unpredictability and overload of multiple tasks and ambiguity at work negatively affected their well-being. Furthermore, the findings show that certain managerial behaviors can promote or negatively impact employee well-being. Managers’ behaviors that promote employee well-being include, for example, demonstrating appreciation and recognition at work, showing responsiveness, and providing support and clarity. Lack of responsiveness, excessive control over participants’ work, and failure to allocate resources or manage workloads were perceived as impediments to workplace well-being.\nThis study suggests that organizations can adopt the Job Demand-Resource Model to identify the specific job resources and demands that influence employee well-being. This can lead to more effective interventions addressing these factors and increase overall employee well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Presentation"

    "text": "1. Being humble but not afraid | Be aware of the battles with data\nYour data may not be as good as you think, but that does not mean you have to throw it away.\nWhy your data is probably as not good as you think it is?\nThere are some reasons:\n\nSelection bias\n\nOften when we are working with data, like the results of an engagement survey, we are not working with a random sample.  \nMuch of the statistics is built on the assumption that we are working with a random representative sample.\nWe are not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou do not have to throw away your engagement survey data.\nJust because it is not representative, clarify what you are measuring.\nInstead of saying something like ninety percent of people would recommend this company to a friend, say ninety percent of people who took this survey, to remember that there are people out there or some percentage that haven’t taken it, whose opinions you actually might be most interested in or always very interested in. \nCompanies often throw this out, but the participation rates are data. If more and more people are not participating in your engagement survey over time, that is information.\n\n\n\nMeasurement\n\nYou are probably not measuring what you think you are measuring.\nMany companies when they want to measure talent, measure something like leadership. They assess people’s leadership skills by giving them a score from one to five. However, these scores often reflect how much you like someone rather than their leadership abilities.\nThere are better ways to measure this, but most companies do not use them. They ask if you are a leader or not, and give you a score.\nAlso, they do not regularly check if their measurement methods are still good. Sometimes, they change the criteria from leadership to something else like grit, without proper validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAsk yourself: How do I know I am measuring what I think I am measuring? (validity)\nThere are techniques such as:\n\nconceptualization - What do I mean by the thing I am talking about?\noperationalization - How am I going to turn that into a number? How am I going to go back and check the validity that I am measuring what I want?\n\nMany companies do not take this step.\nAsk yourself: What am I not asking about? What else could I ask about? (exclusion)\nWhat is the exclusion? (asking about what you want to ask about on a survey). For example, think about your engagement surveys.\nYou want to ensure you are asking questions that matter to the people. One good way to do that is to first ask them what matters to you rather than just saying do you feel you belong or do you feel ….\nMake sure you are asking your people:\n\nwhat do they want about\nwhat they want to tell you\n\n\n\n\nData siloing with people’s data\n\nPeople say they have performance data, engagement data, and DEI data separately rather than mix them all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPerformance data in particular is not objective truth. Data about your people is data about your people. We do not have to keep it in separate categories.\nThere is:\n\nsimilarity bias\nwhat we are looking for in the first place\ncontext that we have to take into account.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nSelection Bias. Who are you over or under-counting?\nMeasurement. How to measure what you want?\nData siloing with people data. Remember, performance data does not equal truth."

    "text": "2. The scientific method to the rescue | Use the scientific method\n\nIf you are not sure where to focus your analysis or what data to collect, start with a theory and hypothesis.\n\nWhat (the author saw) most organizations do. They say:\n\nI care about DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).\nHere are a million metrics about things related to demographic identity.\nWomen and Black employees leave the company at higher rates than other groups.\n\nThey better implement all kinds of best practices without actually figuring out what is going on at their organization or giving any thought to whether these practices are “best” for their organization.\n\nI might form an ERG, conduct an annual engagement survey, and hope for the best.\nAsk Black employees about their experiences and then ignore the results because they are not “statistically significant”, and/or dismiss their interviews as “anecdotal”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the author suggests to try:\n\n\n\n\nBe curious about something – Why are Black talent leaving the company?\nObserve - They are leaving at X rate, vs white talent at Y rate.\nHave a theory – Lack of inclusion leads to disengagement.\nHypothesis - One possible, observable implication: If talked over at meetings, or interrupted, you do not feel included, and you are more likely to leave.\nCollect data – Record interruption or speaking time!\nTest hypotheses – If the theory is correct, I should observe that being interrupted predicts leaving. I should observe evidence consistent with the H1.\nRevise theory and repeat – I reject H0. Now, I can explore more avenues, refine theory, and maybe implement policy.\n\n\n\nThe only two stages in our data analysis that involve data:\n\nObservation\nCollection and testing.\n\nOtherwise, it is all thinking.\nWhen we think of data science, we tend to think of spreadsheets graphs, and data dashboards.\nIt is mostly sitting and thinking hard about what to look for and how to know if you have learned something.\nSummary\nIf you are overwhelmed, and do not know where to start, or what data to get:\n\nBegin from a place of curiosity (start with questions, not answers);\nUse a theory and a hypothesis to focus your analysis (will help clarify what data you need);\nLook for observable implications."
