    "text": "Abstract\nEmployee well-being is essential for both individuals and organizations. Despite large investments by organizations in improving employee well-being, research has shown a deterioration over time. To address this problem, researchers advise organizations to look beyond statistical data and investigate the underlying causes of employees’ low perception of well-being. This study aims to explore the work environment factors and managers’ behaviors that employees perceive as influencing their well-being at work and how they perceive them. Following a qualitative research design, data were collected cross-sectionally using semi-structured interviews involving 11 employees from various occupations, organizations, and industries. A template analysis strategy was used for data analysis. The findings reveal a variety of job resources and demands that influence well-being at work. Factors such as social support at work, autonomy and flexibility in work, opportunities for professional development, and relevant feedback were all perceived by participants as positively influencing their well-being. On the other hand, dealing with the unpredictability and overload of multiple tasks and ambiguity at work negatively affected their well-being. Furthermore, the findings show that certain managerial behaviors can promote or negatively impact employee well-being. Managers’ behaviors that promote employee well-being include, for example, demonstrating appreciation and recognition at work, showing responsiveness, and providing support and clarity. Lack of responsiveness, excessive control over participants’ work, and failure to allocate resources or manage workloads were perceived as impediments to workplace well-being. This study suggests that organizations can adopt the Job Demand-Resource Model to identify the specific job resources and demands that influence employee well-being. This can lead to more effective interventions addressing these factors and increase overall employee well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Presentation"

    "text": "Hi, I am Cozmina.\nWhen I started working in sales, I didn’t know exactly what I would be doing. I soon realized that selling was a means to what I truly enjoyed: helping customers solve business problems. Later, when I managed teams, I had the opportunity to help people to develop and grow. Although I have enjoyed my work at Vodafone, after 14 years, I felt trapped in my comfort zone, which worried me. So, I left the company without a clear plan for what I wanted to do next.\nA new journey started, filled with challenges, acquiring new skills, and setting new goals. I learned a lot about myself and my direction. In 2023, after completing a graduate degree in strategic human resource management, which included coursework in organizational strategy, change management, empirical social research (qualitative and quantitative), and digital HR, I decided to transition to people analytics. My goal is to help others make data-driven decisions."
