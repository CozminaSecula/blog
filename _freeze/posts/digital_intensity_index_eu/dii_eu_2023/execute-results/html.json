The DII distinguishes four levels of digital intensity for each enterprise:\n\n-   Enterprises with very low digital intensity index (0-3 points)\n-   Enterprises with low digital intensity index (4-6 points)\n-   Enterprises with high digital intensity index (7-9 points)\n-   Enterprises with very high digital intensity index (10-12 points)\n\nAdditionally, based on the four levels of the DII, a “basic level” of digital intensity is calculated for monitoring the goal of the Digital Decade. A basic level of digital intensity entails the use of at least four of the twelve selected variables, which means it includes enterprises with a low, high and very high level of the DII, excluding the very low level.\n\nOne of the goals for the EU’s digital transformation of businesses is that by 2030, [more than 90% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should reach at least a basic level of digital intensity.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220805-2)\n\n### Enterprises with basic level of digital intensity in 2023\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(DT)\nsleep_default <- 3\n\nSys.sleep(sleep_default)\ncon <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),\n                      dbname = 'digital_transformation_of_business', \n                 host = 'localhost', \n                 port = 5432, \n                 user = Sys.getenv(\"DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME\"),\n                 password = Sys.getenv(\"DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD\"),\n                 bigint = \"integer\") # change integer64 to integer\n\ndii_eu_countries <- dbGetQuery(con, '\nSELECT \n  y.\"ExpPeriod\" AS \"Year\",\n  c.\"ExpCountryCaption\" AS \"Country\",\n  c.\"ExpCountry\" AS \"geo\",\n  i.\"ExpIndicatorCaption\" AS \"Indicator\",\n  es.\"ExpEntSizeCaption\" AS \"Enterprise Size\",\n  a.\"ExpActivityCaption\" AS \"Activity\",\n  u.\"ExpUnitCaption\" AS \"Unit\",\n  COALESCE(CAST(dwa.\"Value\" AS decimal) *100, 0) AS \"Value\",\n  dwa.\"Flags\" ,\n  n.\"Note\" \nFROM public.\"DataWithAggregates\" dwa \nINNER JOIN public.\"Years\" y ON dwa.\"IdYear\" = y.\"IdYear\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"Countries\" c ON dwa.\"IdCountry\" = c.\"IdCountry\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"Indicators\" i ON dwa.\"IdIndicator\" = i.\"IdIndicator\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"EntSizes\" es ON dwa.\"IdEntSize\" = es.\"IdEntSize\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"Activities\" a ON dwa.\"IdActivity\" = a.\"IdActivity\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"Regions\" r ON dwa.\"IdRegion\" = r.\"IdRegion\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"CustBrkdwns\" cb ON dwa.\"IdCustBrkdwn\" = cb.\"IdCustBrkdwn\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"Units\" u ON dwa.\"IdUnit\" = u.\"IdUnit\" \nINNER JOIN public.\"Notes\" n ON dwa.\"IdYear\"  = n.\"IdYear\" AND dwa.\"IdNote\" = n.\"IdNote\" \nWHERE y.\"IdYear\" = 23\n  AND c.\"IdCountry\" IN (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,45,48)\n  AND i.\"IdIndicator\" IN (1785,1786,1787,1788,1940,1941,1942,1943,2400,2401,2402,2403,2534,2535,2536,2537,3159,3360)\n  AND es.\"IdEntSize\" = 2578\n  AND a.\"IdActivity\" = 2585\n  AND r.\"IdRegion\" = 2631\n  AND cb.\"IdCustBrkdwn\" = 2632 \n  AND u.\"IdUnit\" = 16\nORDER BY \"Value\";')\n\ndii_filtered <- dii_eu_countries |>\n  select(Year, Country, Indicator, Unit,Value) |>\n  filter(Indicator == 'Enterprises with at least low (basic) digital intensity index (DII Version 3)') |>\n  mutate(Value = as.numeric(round(Value, 2)),\n         Year = 2023)\n  \ndatatable(dii_filtered, \n          options = list(pageLength = 5, \n          scrollY = TRUE),\n          caption = \"Source: Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/digital-economy-and-society/\\ndatabase/comprehensive-database)\" \n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-57592321d893cb714f64\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-57592321d893cb714f64\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"caption\":\"<caption>Source: Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/digital-economy-and-society/\\ndatabase/comprehensive-database)<\\/caption>\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\",\"26\",\"27\",\"28\"],[2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023,2023],[\"Romania\",\"Bulgaria\",\"Greece\",\"Slovakia\",\"Latvia\",\"Czechia\",\"Poland\",\"Slovenia\",\"France\",\"Hungary\",\"Portugal\",\"Estonia\",\"Croatia\",\"European Union -

Below is the composition for the 2023:\n\n1.  Enterprises where more than 50% of the persons employed have access to the internet for business purposes.\n2.  The maximum contracted download speed of the fastest fixed internet connection is at least 30 Mb/s.\n3.  Enterprises with e-commerce sales of at least 1% turnover.\n4.  Enterprises where web sales were more than 1% of the total turnover and B2C web sales more than 10% of the web sales.\n5.  Buy cloud computing services used over the internet.\n6.  Enterprises buying sophisticated or intermediate cloud computing services.\n7.  Use two or more social media.\n8.  Use any social media.\n9.  Data analytics for the enterprise is performed by the enterprise's own employees or by an external provider\n10. Use any AI technology.\n11. Enterprises having ERP software package to share information between different functional areas.\n12. Enterprises using Customer Relationship Management (CRM).\n\nMore information about Digital Intensity Index [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/isoc_e_dii_esmsip2.htm).\n\nThe visualization was inspired by [Milos Popovic](https://milospopovic.net/) and his [tutorial](https://milospopovic.net/inset-graph-within-map/) on making a visualization with a graph and a map.\n",
