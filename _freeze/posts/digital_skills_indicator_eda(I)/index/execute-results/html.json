Previously, I explored the [Digital Intensity Index](https://cozminasecula.github.io/blog/posts/digital_intensity_index_components_eu/), which measures the digital transformation of businesses. This time, the focus is on the DSI, which assess the human capital dimension of the EU Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI).\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to improve our understanding of the current state of digital competencies within the EU population and to evaluate the progress made in 2023 compared to 2021. First, I will provide an overview of composite indicators and introduce the DSI. Then, using open data from Eurostat, I will perform an exploratory analysis of the DSI components and conclude by sharing key insights from the analysis.\n\n## Introducing Digital Skills Indicator\n\nIn this section, I introduce the Digital Skills Indicator (DSI), a composite measure used to assess the digital competencies of individuals across the EU.\n\nBefore diving into composite indicators, it is essential to understand what indicators are. **Indicators** are tools used across various fields, such as economics, education, health, and environmental science, to monitor changes, trends, or conditions. You might already be familiar with key performance indicators (KPIs), which are quantitative or qualitative measures used to track progress toward specific goals. However, when dealing with complex, multi-dimensional issues, individual indicators may not suffice. This is where composite indicators come into play.\n\n### Composite indicators\n\n**Composite indicators** aggregate multiple individual indicators into a single, comprehensive measure, offering a summarized view of complex phenomena. For instance, the Human Development Index (HDI) combines indicators like life expectancy, education level, and income to measure a country’s overall development.\n\nCreating a composite indicator involves several steps: selecting relevant individual indicators, normalizing them (especially when they are on different scales), assigning weights based on their importance, and then aggregating them into a final score. The primary purpose of composite indicators is to simplify complex data, making it easier to interpret, compare, and communicate findings, particularly in broad, multi-dimensional contexts.\n\n### Digital Skills Indicator\n\nThe Digital Skills Indicator (DSI) is crucial for tracking the EU’s progress toward its Digital Decade goals, specifically the target that by 2030, at least 80% of citizens aged 16-74 will possess at least basic digital skills.\n\nThe DSI is a composite indicator derived from surveys on ICT (Information and Communication Technology) use in households and by individuals. It assesses five key areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving. The assumption is that individuals who perform specific digital activities possess the corresponding skills. To be classified as having at least basic digital skills, individuals must demonstrate competence in at least one activity in each of these areas.\n\nThe DSI focuses on people aged 16-74[^1], and for detailed information on DSI levels and the activities related to each skill, Eurostat provides comprehensive [metadata](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/isoc_sk_dskl_i21_esmsip2.htm).\n\n[^1]: Source: [Digital Economy and Society. Information on data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/digital-economy-and-society/information-data#Information%20on%20variables,%20countries,%20and%20data%20collection)\n\n## Competence Areas[^2]\n\n[^2]: Source: [DigComp Framework](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/oldpage-digcomp/digcomp-framework_en)\n\nThe Digital Skills Indicator covers five core competence areas, which are essential for assessing digital skills:\n\n::: column-page\n::: grid-container\n::: grid-item\n**Information and Data Literacy**\n\n-   Articulate information needs.\n\n-   Locate and retrieve digital data, information, and content.\n\n-   Judge the relevance of the source and its content.\n\n-   Store, manage, and organize digital data, information, and content.\n:::\n\n::: grid-item\n**Communication and Collaboration**\n\n-   Interact, communicate, and collaborate through digital technologies.\n\n-   Be aware of cultural and generational diversity.\n\n-   Participate in society through public and private digital services.\n\n-   Manage one’s digital presence, identity, and reputation.\n:::\n\n::: grid-item\n**Digital Content Creation**\n\n-   Create and edit digital content.\n\n-   Improve and integrate information and content into an existing body of knowledge.\n\n-   Understand how copyright and licenses are to be applied.\n\n-   Know how to give understandable instructions for a computer system.\n:::\n\n::: grid-item\n**Safety**\n\n-   Protect devices, content, personal data, and privacy in digital environments.\n\n-   Protect physical and psychological health.\n\n-   Be aware of digital technologies for social well-being and social inclusion.\n\n-   Be aware of the environmental impact of digital technologies and their use.\n:::\n\n::: grid-item\n**Problem Solving**\n\n-   Identify needs and problems in digital environments.\n\n-   Resolve conceptual problems and problem situations in digital environments.\n\n-   Use digital tools to innovate processes and products.\n\n-   Keep up-to-date with the digital evolution.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Why Understanding Digital Skills Data Matters\n\nIn today’s increasingly digital world, possessing digital skills is a necessity. Understanding DSI data is crucial as it provides insights into the current state of digital competencies within the EU population. This data is vital for policymakers, educators, businesses, and individuals to identify areas where digital skills are lacking, target interventions, and monitor progress toward digital literacy goals. Staying informed about digital skills data ensures that societies can effectively participate in the digital economy, foster innovation, and close the digital divide.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nThe Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focuses on understanding DSI data, uncovering patterns, and generating hypotheses for further research. This involves visualizing data, calculating summary statistics, and identifying trends and relationships among variables.\n\nThe key question guiding this analysis is: *What do the distributions of the Digital Skills Indicator components for 2021 and 2023 reveal about the overall shifts in digital skills across the EU population?*\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data analyzed in this post is sourced from Eurostat’s database on individuals’ digital skills. The analysis uses several packages, including `eurostat`[^3] for data retrieval, `tidyverse`[^4] for data manipulation and visualization, `janitor`[^5] for data cleaning, `reactable`[^6] for interactive tables and `patchwork`[^7] for plot composition.\n\n[^3]: Lahti L., Huovari J., Kainu M., and Biecek P.

Skill Levels\n\nBelow are some key observations beased on the above analysis:\n\n1.  **General Trends Over Time**\n\nAcross all skill categories, there is a general improvement in skill levels from 2021 to 2023. For example, the percentage of individuals with above basic *Communication and Collaboration skills* increased from 79.96% in 2021 to 82.84% in 2023. Similarly, individuals with above basic *Problem-solving skills* saw an increase from 55.53% in 2021 to 58.05% in 2023. These improvements suggest that the EU is making positive steps toward achieving its 2030 digital skills goals. However, the progress also highlights the need for sustained efforts to ensure that all areas of digital competency are advancing at a similar pace.\n\n2.  **Strengths and Opportunities in Digital Skills Development**\n\nThe data shows a notable concentration of individuals with above-basic skills, especially in categories like *Communication and Collaboration* and *Information and Data Literacy*. For example, in 2023, while only 6.64% of individuals had basic communication and collaboration skills, 82.84% had above-basic skills. This indicates a strong proficiency at higher levels in these areas, reflecting significant progress. However, this pattern is not consistent across all skill categories. In areas such as *Safety*, *Problem-solving* and *Digital Content Creation*, the proportion of individuals with above-basic skills is much lower, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to boost advanced competencies in these critical domains.\n\n3.  **Overall Digital Skills**\n\nWhen examining *Overall Digital Skills*, the percentage of individuals with above basic skills is considerably lower compared to specific skills. In 2023, only 28.98% of individuals had above basic overall digital skills. This suggests that while people may excel in specific areas, comprehensive digital proficiency across all indicators remains a challenge.\n\n4.  **At Least Basic Skills**\n\nThe distinction between basic or above basic (at least basic skills) and \"above basic\" skill levels shows that a significant portion of individuals meet at least the basic criteria, but fewer achieve above basic proficiency. For example, in 2023, 57.63% of individuals had basic or above basic *Overall Digital skills*, but only 28.98% reached above basic proficiency. This highlights the need for policies aimed at helping more individuals advance to above basic level. Such progress is crucial for the EU to meet its ambitious digital skills goals.\n\n5.  **Safety and Digital Content Creation Skills**\n\nThe data indicates that *Safety* and *Digital Content Creation skills* are generally weaker compared to other areas. In 2021, only 43.65% of individuals had above basic safety skills, and 46.56% had above basic digital content creation skills. In contrast, higher percentages were observed in areas like *Information and Data Literacy* (74.42%) and *Communication and Collaboration* (79.96%). This trend continues in 2023, suggesting a need for targeted initiatives to improve safety and content creation skills.Targeted initiatives, such as specialized training programs or awareness campaigns, could help improve competencies in these critical domains.\n\n6.  **Range of Skills Levels**\n\nThere is considerable variation across regions or countries, as implied by the minimum and maximum values. For instance, in 2023, the range for above basic *Problem-solving skills* spans from 21.93% to 87.4%, indicating a significant gap between the most and least proficient groups. Although country-specific details I will explore in a separate analysis, the overall variation highlights the need for tailored interventions that address the unique challenges faced by different regions within the EU.\n\n7.  **Stability of Median Values**\n\nThe median values across years are generally stable, indicating that improvements in mean values are not driven by outliers. This stability suggests consistent progress across the population rather than isolated improvements among a few groups. However, there are some exceptions, such as in *Problem-solving skills* and *Overall Digital skills*, basic or above skills, where extreme values are more prominent.\n\n8.  **Variability of skills**\n\nThere is low variability in basic skills. For example, the standard deviations for basic skills, such as *Information and Data Literacy Skills* and *Communication and Collaboration Skills*, are low, indicating consistent skill levels among individuals. In contrast, there is higher variability in above basic skills. The standard deviations for above basic skills, particularly in *Digital Content Creation* and *Information and Data Literacy*, are significantly higher, reflecting greater differences in proficiency levels among individuals.\n\nAmong the six categories, *Problem Solving Skills* and *Safety Skills* exhibit the highest variability, suggesting a wide range of abilities within these areas.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe data analysis reveals both progress and challenges in the development of digital skills across the EU. While improvements from 2021 to 2023 are encouraging, disparities in skill levels and the slower progress in certain areas, such as *Safety* and *Digital Content Creation*, indicate that more targeted policies and initiatives are necessary.\n\nOverall, while there is positive momentum, the findings suggest that achieving comprehensive digital proficiency across the EU will require continued and targeted efforts.
