Previously, I explored the [Digital Intensity Index](https://cozminasecula.github.io/blog/posts/digital_intensity_index_components_eu/), which measures the digital transformation of businesses. This time, the focus is on the Digital Skills Indicator (DSI), one of key performance indicators in the context of the Digital Decade.\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to improve our understanding of the current state of digital competencies within the EU population and to evaluate the progress made in 2023 compared to 2021. First, I will provide an overview of composite indicators and introduce the DSI. Then, I will use data from Eurostat to conduct an exploratory data analysis of the DSI components and share key insights from the analysis.\n\n## Introducing Digital Skills Indicator\n\nIn this section, I introduce the Digital Skills Indicator, a composite measure used to assess the digital competencies of individuals across the EU.\n\nFirst, I will introduce indicators. **Indicators** are tools used across various fields, such as economics, education, health, and environmental science, to monitor changes, trends, or conditions. You might already be familiar with key performance indicators (KPIs), which are quantitative or qualitative measures used to track progress toward specific goals. However, when addressing complex, multi-dimensional issues, relying on individual indicators alone may not be enough. This is where composite indicators come into play.\n\n### Composite indicators\n\n**Composite indicators** aggregate multiple individual indicators into a single, comprehensive measure, offering a summarized view of complex phenomena. For instance, the Human Development Index (HDI) combines indicators like life expectancy, education level, and income to measure a country’s overall development.\n\nCreating a composite indicator involves several steps: selecting relevant individual indicators, normalizing them (especially when they are on different scales), assigning weights based on their importance, and then aggregating them into a final score. The primary purpose of composite indicators is to simplify complex data, making it easier to interpret, compare, and communicate findings, particularly in broad, multi-dimensional contexts.\n\n### Digital Skills Indicator\n\nThe Digital Skills Indicator (DSI) is essential for monitoring the EU’s progress towards its Digital Decade goals. Specifically, the 2030 target is that at least 80% of citizens aged 16-74 have at least basic digital skills.\n\nThe DSI is a composite indicator derived from surveys on ICT (Information and Communication Technology) use in households and by individuals. It assesses five key areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving. The assumption is that individuals who perform specific digital activities possess the corresponding skills. To be classified as having at least basic digital skills, individuals must demonstrate competence in at least one activity in each of these areas.\n\nFor detailed information on DSI levels and the activities related to each skill, Eurostat provides comprehensive [metadata](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/isoc_sk_dskl_i21_esmsip2.htm).\n\n## Why Understanding Digital Skills Data Matters\n\nIn today’s digital world, possessing digital skills is a necessity. Understanding DSI data is essential as it provides insights into the current state of digital competencies within the EU population. This data is vital for policymakers, educators, businesses, and individuals to identify areas where digital skills are lacking, target interventions, and monitor progress toward digital literacy goals. Staying informed about digital skills data ensures that societies can effectively participate in the digital economy, foster innovation, and close the digital divide.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focuses on understanding DSI data, identifying patterns, and generating hypotheses for further analysis. This involves visualizing data, calculating summary statistics, and identifying trends and relationships among variables.\n\nThe key question guiding this analysis is: *What do the distributions of the Digital Skills Indicator components for 2021 and 2023 reveal about the overall shifts in digital skills across the EU population?*\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data analyzed is sourced from Eurostat’s database on individuals’ digital skills.\n\nThe analysis uses several packages, including `eurostat`[^1] for data retrieval, `tidyverse`[^2] for data manipulation and visualization, `janitor`[^3] for data cleaning, `reactable`[^4] for interactive tables and `patchwork`[^5] for plot composition.\n\n[^1]: Lahti L., Huovari J., Kainu M., and Biecek P.

There is a slight shift in distribution between the two years for most components, indicating possible changes in proficiency levels over time.\n\n-   Above Basic Skills: The histograms for above basic skills show higher proficiency levels. The data for 2023 often shows a broader spread or a slight shift compared to 2021, suggesting an increase in higher proficiency levels in some countries.\n\n-   Basic or Above Skills: The combined category shows that the majority of countries have a high percentage of individuals with at least basic digital skills. The distributions are generally skewed towards higher values, with some movement between the years.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Set global font family\ntheme_set(theme_minimal(base_family = \"Roboto\"))\n\n# Prepare data (pivot_wider)\ndigital_skills_hist <- digital_skills_distrib |>\n  pivot_wider(names_from = indicator_level, values_from = value) |>\n  clean_names()\n\n# Define color for each proficiency level\ncolors <- c(\"Above Basic Skills\" = \"white\",  \n            \"Basic Skills\" = \"white\",        \n            \"Basic or Above Skills\" = \"white\") \n\n\n# Function to generate the plots for each skill\nplot_skill_histograms <- function(data, skill) {\n  skill_data <- data |>\n    filter(digital_skills == skill)\n\n\n  # Basic Skills plot\n  plot_basic <- ggplot(skill_data, aes(x = individuals_with_basic_skills)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"#222222\",\n                   fill = colors[\"Basic Skills\"],\n                   binwidth = function(x) (max(x) -

For example, the percentage of individuals with above basic *Communication and Collaboration* skills increased from 79.96% in 2021 to 82.84% in 2023. Similarly, individuals with above basic *Problem-solving* skills saw an increase from 55.53% in 2021 to 58.05% in 2023. These improvements suggest that the EU is making positive steps toward achieving its 2030 digital skills goals. However, the progress also highlights the need for sustained efforts to ensure that all areas of digital competency are advancing at a similar pace.\n\n2.  **Strengths and Opportunities in Digital Skills Development**\n\nThe data shows a notable concentration of individuals with above basic skills, especially in categories like *Communication and Collaboration* and *Information and Data Literacy*. For example, in 2023, while only 6.64% of individuals had basic communication and collaboration skills, 82.84% had above-basic skills. This indicates a strong proficiency at higher levels in these areas, reflecting significant progress. However, this pattern is not consistent across all skill categories. In areas such as *Safety*, *Problem-solving* and *Digital Content Creation*, the proportion of individuals with above basic skills is much lower, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to boost advanced competencies in these critical domains.\n\n3.  **Overall Digital Skills**\n\nWhen examining *Overall Digital Skills*, the percentage of individuals with above basic skills is considerably lower compared to specific skills. In 2023, only 28.98% of individuals had above basic overall digital skills. This suggests that while people may excel in specific areas, comprehensive digital proficiency across all indicators remains a challenge.\n\n4.  **Safety and Digital Content Creation Skills**\n\nThe data indicates that *Safety* and *Digital Content Creation* skills are generally weaker compared to other areas. In 2021, only 43.65% of individuals had above basic safety skills, and 46.56% had above basic digital content creation skills. In contrast, higher percentages were observed in areas like *Information and Data Literacy* (74.42%) and *Communication and Collaboration* (79.96%). This trend continues in 2023, suggesting a need for targeted initiatives to improve safety and content creation skills.Targeted initiatives, such as specialized training programs or awareness campaigns, could help improve competencies in these critical domains.\n\n5.  **Range of Skills Levels**\n\nThere is considerable variation across regions or countries, as implied by the minimum and maximum values. For instance, in 2023, the range for above basic *Problem-solving* skills spans from 21.93% to 87.4%, indicating a significant gap between the most and least proficient groups. Although country-specific details I will explore in a separate analysis, the overall variation highlights the need for tailored interventions that address the unique challenges faced by different regions within the EU.\n\n6.  **Stability of Median Values**\n\nThe median values across years are generally stable, indicating that improvements in mean values are not driven by outliers. This stability suggests consistent progress across the population rather than isolated improvements among a few groups. However, there are some exceptions, such as in *Problem-solving* skills and *Overall Digital skills*, basic or above skills, where extreme values are more prominent.\n\n7.  **Variability of skills**\n\nThere is low variability in basic skills. For example, the standard deviations for basic skills, such as *Information and Data Literacy* and *Communication and Collaboration* skills, are low, indicating consistent skill levels among individuals. In contrast, there is higher variability in above basic skills. The standard deviations for above basic skills, particularly in *Digital Content Creation* and *Information and Data Literacy*, are significantly higher, reflecting greater differences in proficiency levels among individuals.\n\nAmong the six categories, *Problem Solving Skills* and *Safety Skills* exhibit the highest variability, suggesting a wide range of abilities within these areas.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe data analysis reveals both progress and challenges in the development of digital skills across the EU.
