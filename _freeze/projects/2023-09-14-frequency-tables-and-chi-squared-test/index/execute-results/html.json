However, for data to be valuable, it requires analysis and interpretation, which is where analytic techniques become critical. This presentation introduces two distinct tools for initiating data analysis with categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.\n\nFrequency tables serve as a statistical instrument for categorical data analysis. They achieve this by counting the occurrences of variables within a data set, providing a concise overview of the distribution and patterns within these categorical variables. When analyzing categorical data, it is often essential to determine if a significant relationship exists between two categorical variables within data set. The chi-squared test helps determine whether these two variables are associated or functionally related. In simpler terms, it quantifies the degree of independence between two categorical variables. When employed together, these tools can unveil intriguing patterns and relationships within data.\n\nThe presentation will guide you through the utilization of frequency tables and the chi-squared test for insightful data analysis.\n\n# Slides\n\n\n\n```{css echo=FALSE}\n\n.iframe-container {\n   position:absolute;\n}\n\n```\n\n```{=html}\n\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"path_to_your_presentation.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"slides.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" border=\"0\" >\n\n</iframe>\n\n",
