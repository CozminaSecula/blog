In [the previous post on analyzing EU's Digital Intensity Index](https://cozminasecula.github.io/blog/posts/eurostat_statistics/dii_eu_2023.html), I enumerated the 12 components of the index. As a result of learning more about the index's components, I was curious to know how the enterprises that participated in the survey performed for each component.

In this post, using data analysis and visualization techniques and tools, I analyze the components of the DII index for each EU country, specifically, I will answer the question:

-   **Which countries score highest or lowest on the EU's digital intensity index's 12 components?**

### Prerequisites

Sys.sleep(sleep_default)
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
                      dbname = 'digital_transformation_of_business', 
                 host = 'localhost', 
                 port = 5432, 
                 user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
                 password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
                 bigint = "integer") 
```

## 1. Build Data Set for Analysis

For this analysis, I used open data provided by Eurostat, the [results of the EU survey on ICT usage and e-commerce in enterprises 2023, available in MS-Access format](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/digital-economy-and-society/database/comprehensive-database). This format allowed me to work with database files and make the data set I needed for the analysis.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true


sql_dataset <- '
SELECT 
  y."ExpPeriod" AS "Year",
  c."ExpCountryCaption" AS "Country",
  r."ExpRegionCaption" AS "Region",
  i."ExpIndicatorCaption" AS "Indicator",
  r."ExpRegion" AS "Geo",
  es."ExpEntSizeCaption" AS "EnterpriseSize",
  a."ExpActivityCaption" AS "Activity",
  u."ExpUnitCaption" AS "Unit",
  COALESCE(CAST(dwa."Value" AS decimal) *100, 0) AS "Value",
  dwa."Flags" ,
  n."Note" 
FROM public."DataWithAggregates" dwa 
INNER JOIN public."Years" y ON dwa."IdYear" = y."IdYear" 
INNER JOIN public."Countries" c ON dwa."IdCountry" = c."IdCountry" 
INNER JOIN public."Indicators" i ON dwa."IdIndicator" = i."IdIndicator" 
INNER JOIN public."EntSizes" es ON dwa."IdEntSize" = es."IdEntSize" 
INNER JOIN public."Activities" a ON dwa."IdActivity" = a."IdActivity" 
INNER JOIN public."Regions" r ON dwa."IdRegion" = r."IdRegion" 
INNER JOIN public."CustBrkdwns" cb ON dwa."IdCustBrkdwn" = cb."IdCustBrkdwn" 
INNER JOIN public."Units" u ON dwa."IdUnit" = u."IdUnit" 
INNER JOIN public."Notes" n ON dwa."IdYear"  = n."IdYear" AND dwa."IdNote" = n."IdNote" 
WHERE y."IdYear"  IN (23)
  AND c."IdCountry" IN (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,45)
  AND i."IdIndicator" IN (1525, 2256, 315, 1499, 1598, 2347, 1769, 1764, 3124, 2305, 1068, 3122)
  AND es."IdEntSize" IN (2578)
  AND a."IdActivity" IN (2585) 
  AND cb."IdCustBrkdwn" IN (2632) 
  AND u."IdUnit" IN (16)
ORDER BY "Year", "Value"'

sql_dataset_tbl <- as_tibble(dbGetQuery(con,sql_dataset))

```

## 2. Prepare the Data

### 2.1 Data Description

Data from the EU survey on ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) usage and e-commerce in enterprises 2023 provided by Eurostat, are collected annually by the National Statistical Institutes and are based on the annual Eurostat model questionnaires on ICT usage and e-commerce in enterprises.

The model questionnaire on ICT usage and e-commerce in enterprises provides a large variety of variables covering among others the following areas:

-   General information about ICT systems

-   Access to and use of the internet including mobile use of the internet

-   e-commerce

-   e-business including Artificial Intelligence, Data analytics, Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Big data analysis, 3D printing, Robotics, etc.

-   ICT specialists, training on ICT and e-skills

-   ICT security

-   ICT and the environment[^1].

[^1]: For more details the metadata are available here: <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/isoc_e_esms.htm>

#### The structure, data types, and content of the data set.

-   There are 822 observations and 11 variables.
-   The data type is a string (character) for all variables except the `Value` variable which is of data type numeric (double).
-   There are missing values only for the `Flags` and `Note` variables which is ok because these variables have values only if there is something special to mention.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true

glimpse(sql_dataset_tbl)
skimr::skim(sql_dataset_tbl)

```

#### Description of variables

The data set contains the following variables:

-   `Year` - the year when the survey was conducted (2023)
-   `Country` - the EU countries (27) + European Union - 27 countries (from 2020)
-   `Region` the regions of each country
-   `Geo` - the geographical code for each region
-   `Indicator` - the 12 components of the Digital Intensity Index in 2023
-   `Enterprise size` - 10 persons employed or more
-   `Activity` - All activities, without financial sector
-   `Unit` - Percentage of enterprises
-   `Value` - the value, rounded to 4 decimals
-   `Flags` - The flags attached to the value if it is the case
-   `Note` - The text of a specific note mentioned if it is the case

## Data Cleaning

As we see, there are no necessary missing values to address and the data type is correct for each variable.

The variable's names are written with capital letters. It is a good practice to use lowercase. However, for this analysis, I will keep them as they are.

The `Indicator` values are too long to be displayed when visualizing the data and I will change them with a shorter version.

I will exclude the data for regions and keep only data for the 27 countries.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

data_cleaned <- sql_dataset_tbl |>
  filter(Geo == "_z" &
        Country != "European Union - 27 countries (from 2020)") |>
  mutate(Value = round(Value, 1),
         Indicator_code = case_when(
           Indicator == "Enterprises use at least one of the AI technologies: AI_TTM, AI_TSR, AI_TNLG, AI_TIR, AI_TML, AI_TPA, AI_TAR" ~ "Use any AI technology",
           Indicator == "Enterprises where web sales are more than 1% of total turnover and B2C web sales more than 10% of the web sales" ~ "Have web sales >1% turnover, B2C web sales >10% web sales",
           Indicator == "Buy cloud computing services used over the internet" ~ "Buy cloud computing services used over the internet",
           Indicator == "Enterprises using Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (as of 2023)" ~ "Use CRM software",
           Indicator == "Enterprises where more than 50% of the persons employed have access to the internet for business purposes" ~"Access to the internet for over 50% of employees",
           Indicator == "Enterprises who have ERP software package to share information between different functional areas" ~"Have ERP software",
           Indicator == "Enterprises with e-commerce sales of at least 1% turnover" ~"Have e-commerce sales of at least 1% turnover",
           Indicator == "Use two or more social media (as of 2014)" ~"Use two or more social media",
           Indicator == "Enterprises buying sophisticated or intermediate CC services, at least one of: CC_PFACC, CC_PERP, CC_PCRM, CC_PSEC, CC_PDB, CC_PDEV" ~ "Buy sophisticated or intermediate cloud computing services",
           Indicator == "Data analytics for the enterprise is performed by the enterprise's own employees or by an external provider" ~"Use data analytics*", 
           Indicator == "Use any social media (as of 2014)" ~ "Use any social media",
           Indicator == "The maximum contracted download speed of the fastest fixed line internet connection is at least 30 Mb/s" ~ "Have fastest fixed line internet at least 30 Mb/s",
           TRUE ~"other")) |>
  select(Country, Indicator, Indicator_code, Value)

head(data_cleaned)

```

#### Identify outliers (IQR method)

One more thing I will do on data cleaning step, is to see if there are outliers. An outlier is a data point that lies outside the overall pattern in a distribution. To detect outliers in the data set I will use the interquartile range (IQR) method. This method indicates that any values in a boxplot that fall outside of Q1 and Q3 are considered outliers. First, let's visualize the distribution.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = Indicator_code, y = Value))+
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, color = "black", alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = scales::label_wrap(10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))+
  labs(
    title = "EU's digital intensity index components distribution",
    caption = "*Data analytics was the new component added in 2023,replacing the 'Enterprises use IoT'."
  ) +
  theme_ts() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6.5),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )

```

The graph shows that the components "Access to the internet for over 50% of employees" and "Use CRM software" have values that lies outside the overall pattern in the distribution.

Next, I will investigate more to find out more about these values.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

# Detect outliers using IQR method
outliers <- data_cleaned |>
  group_by(Indicator_code) |>
  mutate(
    Q1 = round(quantile(Value, 0.25),1),
    Q3 = round(quantile(Value, 0.75),1),
    IQR = round((Q3 - Q1),1),
    Lower_Bound = round(Q1 - (1.5 * IQR), 1),
    Upper_Bound = round(Q3 + (1.5 * IQR), 1),
    Outlier = ifelse(Value < Lower_Bound | Value > Upper_Bound, TRUE, FALSE)
  ) |>
  filter(Outlier == TRUE) |>
  select(-Indicator)

outliers |>
  datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollY = TRUE))

```

In Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, the proportion of enterprises where more than 50% of employees have internet access for business purposes is the lowest, deviating significantly from the overall pattern. Conversely, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Finland exhibit the highest proportions of such enterprises, also deviating from the overall pattern. Regarding the use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, Finland and the Netherland stand out with the highest proportions of enterprises using CRM, again deviating from the overall pattern.

The analysis of the outliers partially answered the question, showing what countries scored the highest or lowest on two out of twelve components. I will move on with the analysis to find out which countries scored the highest or lowest on all digital intensity index components.

## Create Data Frame for the Visualization

Before making the graph and answer the question, I will create the data frame I need for the visualization. I need to find out the maximum and minimum values for each components and country, then I will select only the necessary variables : the digital intensity index components (`Indicator_code`), the countries (`Country`), the `Value`, and the highest and lowest percentages of the enterprises on each component (`Rank_value`).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true


max_min_value <- data_cleaned |>
  group_by(Indicator_code) |>
  mutate(Rank_value = rank(Value)) |>
  filter(Rank_value %in% c(1, 27)) |>
  mutate(Rank_value = ifelse(Rank_value == 1, "Lowest", "Highest")) |>
  select(Country, Indicator_code, Value, Rank_value) |>
  ungroup()

# Set 'Rank_value' factor levels to ensure "Highest" is first
max_min_value <- max_min_value |>
  mutate(Rank_value = factor(Rank_value, levels = c("Highest", "Lowest")))

# Arrange by Value to get the correct order
max_min_value <- max_min_value |>
  arrange(desc(Value))

# Convert 'Indicator_code' to a factor with levels ordered by 'Value', then reverse the order
max_min_value <- max_min_value |>
  mutate(Indicator_code = factor(Indicator_code, levels = rev(unique(Indicator_code))))


max_min_value  |>
  datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollY = TRUE))

```
