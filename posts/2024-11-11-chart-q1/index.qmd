# What are the main types of charts, and how do they differ in their use cases?

On my journey in data visualization, I have learned the importance of carefully choosing the right chart. Why is this so important?

Selecting the right chart is not just about aesthetics; it is about effective communication that leads to better decision-making and action. Using the wrong chart can obscure the message and leave the audience confused.

I found that the first thing to consider when preparing a chart is the audience — who they are, what they need to know, and how best to communicate with them. Next, it’s about the data: What type of data do I have, and which type of visual can turn it into a clear, informative visualization? But with so many chart types available, how do I know I am making the right choice?

In this post, I share key resources I use to understand the main categories of chart types. These resources help me select the right chart effectively and serve as a valuable source of inspiration.

## Why Does Choosing the Right Chart Matter?

For anyone aiming to communicate data effectively, understanding the main categories of charts is essential - not just for clarity, but also for building credibility as a data visualization specialist. This knowledge helps craft compelling data stories and empowers audiences to interpret insights accurately and confidently.

## Visual Encoding

In [Data Visualization: A Handbook for Data Driven Design](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/data-visualisation/book266150#contents), Andy Kirk writes about "ingredients" and "recipes" for visual representation. The ingredients are the marks and attributes, while the recipes are the chart types. When creating a data visualization, we encode data using these components.

**Visual Marks**: These are the elements that represent data items. Examples include:

**Attributes**: These are variations in the appearance of marks that represent values associated with data items. Examples include:

Combining marks and attributes results in **charts**, and understanding which chart types are suitable for different data types is essential.

THE GRAPHIC CONTINUUM

[The Graphic Continuum](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/611-the-graphic-continuum) by Jonathan Schwabish and Severino Ribecca is an excellent reference for exploring chart types.

Examples of chart types by data category:

**Categorical Data**: used for representing distinct groups (e.g., services, regions, teams).

**Temporal Data**: shows trends over time (e.g., forecasts, website traffic, monthly sales).

**Distribution Data**: visualizes data spread and variability (e.g., age distributions in a survey).

**Geospatial Data**: maps regional differences (e.g., demographic distributions).

**Part-to-Whole Data**: illustrates contributions of individual segments to a whole (e.g., market share).

**Relationship Data**: Examines relationships between variables (e.g., advertising spend vs. product sales).

## Summary

This post explores resources that answer the question: *What are the main types of charts, and how do they differ in their use cases?*

Each chart type serves specific purposes:

-   **Comparison**: Comparing data across categories.

-   **Trends Over Time**: Showing changes over time.

-   **Distribution**: Highlighting data spread and variability.

-   **Part-to-Whole**: Illustrating component contributions.

-   **Relationships**: Showing correlations between variables.

-   **Geospatial Data**: Visualizing geographic-related information.

Choosing the appropriate chart type is essential for clearly telling your data story, which leads to improved understanding and informed decision-making.
