# Problem statement

A financial services organization wants to improve customer loyalty[^1]. However, the organization currently lacks an understanding of the key drivers that influence customer loyalty within the company.

[^1]: The case study and the data description are sourced from the book [Predictive HR Analytics : Mastering the HR Metric](https://www.amazon.com/Predictive-HR-Analytics-Mastering-Metric/dp/0749473916) by Dr. Martin R. Edwards and Kirsten Edwards

# Analysis Question

What are the key factors influencing customer loyalty within the organization?

# Analysis objectives

1.  To understand what factors are important in influencing customer loyalty.
2.  To understand which aspects the organization should invest in to improve customer loyalty.

# Methodology

The financial services company carried out a survey. They asked customers who had interacted with a salesperson to assess specific elements of the salesperson’s competence. They were also asked to express their likelihood of reinvesting in the company and to specify the potential amount of their reinvestment. The final question concerned the salesperson’s gender.

# Data collection method

The survey included seven questions.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
### Salesperson competencies

Four were specifically related to key salesperson competency elements:

1.  The salesperson understanding your needs.

2.  The salesperson seems confident.

3.  The salesperson has a recommendation.

4.  The salesperson is knowledgeable.

The customers were asked to grade the salesperson on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 was ‘very dissatisfied’ and 5 was ‘very satisfied’.

### Customer Loyalty

Two question related to loyalty and asked customers to put themselves on a scale of 1 to 5 where:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
5 Likelihood of reinvesting **(Custloyalty)**:

1.  Definitely going to go elsewhere with my investments.

2.  Thinking about going elsewhere with my money.

3.  Not sure about where I will place my future investments.

4.  Thinking about investing here again.

5.  Definitely will invest here again.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
6 How much they may or may not reinvest **(InvestMore)**:

1.  Definitely will not invest more than now here.

2.  Unlikely to invest more than now here.

3.  Planning to invest 0–50 per cent more than now in this organization.

4.  Planning to invest 50–100 per cent more in this organization.

5.  Going to double my investment or more in this organization.

### Gender

The final question was about the gender of the sales person.

7 Sex of sales person: 1 = female; 2 = male.

## Understanding data structure

-   Data structure:
    -   The dataset consists of 2.507 rows, as per the description provided by the data source.
    -   It contains 8 variables. Seven of these represent the questions from the survey, and an additional variable calculates the mean value of the customer satisfaction survey responses.

# Cleaning Data

## Clean name and rename variables

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
### Problem

CustSatMean, Custloyalty, INvestMore have inconsistent entries (e.g. IN..More).

### Solution

-   Clean names and rename these variables

```{r}

# use janitor::clean_name()

(cssurvey_clean <- cssurvey_raw|>
   rename(invest_more = INvestMore,
          cust_loyalty = Custloyalty)|>
    clean_names())


```
:::

## Assign labels and rename variables

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
### Problem

-   The variable names ‘Sat1’, ‘Sat2’, ‘Sat3’, and ‘Sat4’ lack clarity. Although they are numeric in the data set, the data source classifies them as ordinal variables.

-   The variable ‘sex_of_salesperson’ could be more appropriately named as ‘gender’.

### Solution

-   Create new variables based on the existing variables, rename variables, assign labels, and change variable type in factor.

```{r}
#| label: assign-labels

# Create new variables, assign labels, change variable type in factor

(cssurvey_clean <- cssurvey_clean |>
  mutate(undst_cust_need = factor(sat1,
                         levels = c(1:5),
                         labels = c("Very Dissatisfied", "Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied")),
         sales_confidence = factor(sat2,
                         levels = c(1:5),
                         labels = c("Very Dissatisfied", "Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied")),
         give_recomm = factor(sat3,
                         levels = c(1:5),
                         labels = c("Very Dissatisfied", "Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied")),
         product_know = factor(sat4,
                         levels = c(1:5),
                         labels = c("Very Dissatisfied", "Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied")),
         gender = factor(sex_of_salesperson,
                           levels = c(1:2),
                           labels = c("female", "male"))))

# Data Analysis

To achieve the objectives of the analysis, I will conduct a key driver analysis[^3]. One of the goals of this analysis is to understand the factors influencing customer loyalty. I will start by reviewing the survey response percentages in the customer data.

[^3]: I learned about this analysis in the book [People Analytics For Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Analytics-Dummies-Business-Personal-Finance/dp/1119434769) by Mike West

## Percentage of Responses in the Customer Survey Data

Surveyed customers expressed satisfaction and high satisfaction with the ‘The salesperson seems confident’. However, they were less satisfied with ‘The salesperson understanding your needs’ and ‘The salesperson has a recommendation’.

The company might want to address these two aspects that customers are less satisfied with.

```{r}
#| label: compute-percent

# Get the column names of the initial dataset
initial_order <- colnames(cssurvey_clean)[9:12]


# Calculate percentages for each category for each survey question

kda <- cssurvey_clean |>
  drop_na()|>
  pivot_longer(cols = 9:12, names_to = "question", values_to = "value" )|>
  mutate(question= factor(question,
                          levels= initial_order))|>
  count(question, value) |>
  group_by(question)|>
  mutate(prtc = round(n/sum(n) * 100),
         prtc = ifelse(row_number() == n(), 100 - sum(prtc[-n()]), prtc)) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = question, names_from = value, values_from = prtc)

kda$question <- c("The salesperson \nunderstanding your needs",
                 "The salesperson \nseems confident",
                 "The salesperson \nhas a recommendation",
                 "The salesperson \nis knowledgeable")

kda|>
  kableExtra::kable(col.names = c("Question", "Very Dissatisfied", "Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied"),
                    align = "lccccc",
                    caption = "Customer Satisfaction with Salesperson Competencies (%)")
  


```

```{r}
#| label: data-viz-cust-sat


theme_set(theme_msd() + theme(
  axis.title.y = element_blank(),

```

## Correlation

Another approach to analyzing the customer survey data is through correlation. Correlation is a statistical measure of the relationship between two variables, how they are interconnected.

Among the four questions on the survey, at this stage, I aim to identify which ones have the strongest correlation with the question related to customer loyalty: the likelihood of reinvestment.

```{r}
#| label: correlation-coefficient

# Correlation for several pairs of variables
     
cor_cust_loyalty <- cssurvey_clean |>
  select(sat1, sat2, sat3, sat4, cust_loyalty)|>
  cor(method = "spearman",
      use = "pairwise.complete.obs")|>
  round(digits = 2)

survey_quest = c("The salesperson understanding your needs",
                 "The salesperson seems confident",
                 "The salesperson has a recommendation",
                 "The salesperson is knowledgeable")

                        
cor_to_cust_loyalty = c(0.49, 0.37, 0.49, 0.40)
                            
(cor_matrix <- tibble(survey_quest, cor_to_cust_loyalty)|>
    arrange(desc(cor_to_cust_loyalty))|>
  kableExtra::kable(col.names = c("Survey Question", "Correlation to \nCustomer Loyalty"),
                    align = "lr",
                    caption = "Correlation of survey questions to customer loyalty"))


```

‘The salesperson understanding your needs’ and ‘The salesperson has a recommendation’ are the most highly correlated to the question related to loyalty: likelihood of reinvesting. The company might see these areas to focus in its efforts to improve customer loyalty.

## Consolidating the Percentage and Correlation

In this step, I will integrate the customer satisfaction questions and their correlation to customer loyalty into a unified view for enhanced insights. The 'Customer Loyalty Importance' is a calculated metric that combines satisfaction and the correlation in one measure. It allows us to rank survey questions by importance.

```{r}
#| label: consolidate-view-percentage-correlation

# we need to consolidate data from "kda" data set and "cor_matrix" data set

# define cor_matrix as data frame

cor_matrix <- as.data.frame(cor_matrix)

cor_matrix <- tibble(survey_quest, cor_to_cust_loyalty)


kda_cor <- bind_cols(kda, cor_matrix)
  
            
kda_cor <- kda_cor |>
  mutate(percent_dissatisfied = Dissatisfied + `Very Dissatisfied`,
         percent_satisfied = Satisfied + `Very Satisfied`) |>
  group_by(percent_dissatisfied, cor_to_cust_loyalty) |>
  mutate(cust_loyalty_importance = percent_dissatisfied*cor_to_cust_loyalty)|>
  ungroup()
 

kda_consolidate <- kda_cor |>
  select(question, percent_dissatisfied, cor_to_cust_loyalty, cust_loyalty_importance)|>
  arrange(desc(cust_loyalty_importance))|>
  kableExtra::kable(col.names = c("Survey Question", "Percent Dissatisfaction", "Correlation to \nCustomer Loyalty", "Customer Loyalty \nImportance"),
                    align = "lrrr",
                    caption = "Customer Satisfaction items ranked by importance")
  
kda_consolidate

```

```{r}

theme_set(theme_msd() + theme(
  axis.title.y = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
  axis.text.y = element_text(color = GRAY3, size = 10),
  panel.border = element_blank(),
  axis.line = element_line(),
  axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0.03, color = GRAY6, size = 9),
  axis.text.x = element_text(color = GRAY3, size = 10),
  plot.subtitle = element_markdown(hjust = 0),
  axis.line.y = element_blank()
))


kda_consolidate_plot <- kda_cor |>
  mutate(question = fct_reorder(question, cust_loyalty_importance))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = cust_loyalty_importance, y = question))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6, color = GRAY2)+
  geom_text(aes(label = cust_loyalty_importance), hjust = -0.15, size = 3.5)+
  labs(
    title = "The sales person having a reccomendation and understanding customers \nneeds are the issues that require some improvments \n",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "Customer Loyalty Importance"
  )

# Recommendation

The analysis reveals that the variables 'The salesperson is knowledgeable', 'The salesperson understanding your needs', and 'The salesperson has a recommendation' influence customer loyalty. However, only 'salesperson understanding your needs' and 'salesperson has a recommendation' are most important.

To improve customer loyalty, the company could consider improving salespeople’s ability to understand customer needs. This may include active listening, asking relevant questions, and maintaining accurate records. Additionally, providing training for sales staff on making informed recommendations would likely result in a positive return on investment. Identifying employees skilled at understanding and advising customers from raw data and sharing these skills within the team could also be beneficial.

# Summary

In this post, I shared with you my key driver analysis. Here are the steps I followed:

1.  First, I decided what I wanted to understand: What are the key factors influencing customer loyalty within our organization?

2.  From the data available, I selected the measure to understand: customer loyalty (likelihood of reinvesting).

3.  Understand the data.

4.  Clean the data.

5.  Analyze survey data, report the percentage of responses, and run a correlation to establish the strength of the relationship between potential factors and customer loyalty.

6.  Use the correlation coefficient and the percentage of satisfied and dissatisfied responses to analyze the data.

7.  Consider the strength of each factor’s relationship with customer loyalty and current company performance on those factors to focus on actions that will have the most impact.
