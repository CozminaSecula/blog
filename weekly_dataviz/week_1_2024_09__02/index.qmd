## *Countries with the Most Holidays 2024*

The data set, from [MakeOver Monday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) (2024/w36), contains information on public holidays for various countries. It includes the following columns:

-   country: The name of the country.
-   CountriesWithTheMostHolidaysNumberOfPublicHolidays: The number of public holidays in 2024.
-   CountriesWithTheMostHolidaysAdditionalDetails: Additional details about the holidays for some countries, though most of this column is missing data.

## The visualization

The visualization is a bar chart. This makes it easy to compare the number of public holidays across different countries.
