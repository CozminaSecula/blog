## *How many hours do Europeans work each week?*

This week's DataViz is inspired by the [RomanianDATA Tribe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/romaniandata/posts/?feedView=all) challenge for September 2024. The data set, sourced from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/product/page/LFSA_EWHAIS), includes information on the average number of actual weekly hours of work in the main job, by sex, age, professional status, full-time/part-time and occupation.

## The Visualization

For this challenge, I explored the average working hours of full-time and part-time EU employees aged 20-64 from 2014 to 2023. The visualization uses small multiples plots arranged in a map formation to show EU countries' average working hours over time.
