[In a 2021 presentation at the Wharton People Analytics Conference by Andrea Jones-Rooy from the NYU Center for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrrRJO9apqs&list=PL0EdWFC9ZZrWJ2B40bkLZ2bbJAQDmr3cX&index=21), several techniques for making the most of people's data were discussed.

The author explains that these techniques are as follows:

## 1. Data Quality Awareness

Your data may not be as accurate as you think, and this can be due to issues such as selection bias. For instance, when conducting an engagement survey, it's essential to consider if the participants were selected randomly.

## Tip

Don't discard data just because it's not perfectly representative.

Participation rates in surveys also hold valuable information. If more and more people are not participating in your engagement survey over time, that is information.

## 2. Exclusion and Inclusion

Consider what aspects of your data analysis you might have missed. When conducting surveys, ask directly about the concerns and priorities of respondents instead of assuming what they feel.

::: callout-tip
## Tip

Consider these questions: 

 - What have I overlooked?
 
 - What other aspects should I explore? 
 
This process is all about exclusion, which means inquiring about the things you haven't considered yet.

## 3. Data Siloing

Many organizations segregate performance, engagement, and diversity data into separate categories. 

::: callout-tip
## Tip

It is essential to recognize that performance data isn't an absolute truth. It is merely information about your workforce. 

There's no need to maintain strict segregation between data categories. These categories can be integrated for a more comprehensive view.

## 4. Scientific Method Utilization

> If you are not sure where to focus your analysis or what data to collect, start with a theory and hypothesis.

Start by being curious, observe, create a theory and hypothesis, collect data, test your hypothesis, and refine your approach based on the results.

## The author suggests to try:

-   **Be curious about something** -- Why are younger employees leaving at a different rate compared to older employees?
-   **Observe** -- They are leaving at X rate, vs older talent at Y rate.
-   **Have a theory** -- For example, consider if a lack of inclusion is causing disengagement.
-   **Make a hypothesis** -- Think about something you can see, like if people are being interrupted in meetings. This could make them feel excluded and more likely to leave.
-   **Collect data** -- Keep a record of interruptions or speaking time in meetings.
-   **Test hypotheses** -- See if the data shows that being interrupted is connected to leaving. Look for evidence supporting your theory. 
-   **Revise theory and repeat** -- If your theory is right, and you find consistent evidence, you can make changes or policies based on this. If not, you might need to explore other ideas and refine your theory.

# 5. Avoid Reliance on Means

> There is a ton of value to starting simple, and there are also a lot of techniques in between means and machine learning.

Instead of focusing on the average or mean numbers, think about how the experiences of different groups might be different, even if the averages look similar. For instance, an equal average score for men and women doesn't indicate the same experiences. Understanding these differences is essential.


# 6. Cautious Interpretation of Statistical Significance

> This is so important. Companies get fixated on this and miss important results.

Don't get lost in statistical math. Focus on what the numbers mean for your company's goals and values. 

::: callout-tip
## The author suggests to try:

 - Think about whether it's important for your company's goals and values. 
 
 - Focus on substantive significance: Ask if observed differences align with your values as a leader.
 
 - Consider the practical implications beyond statistical significance.

# 7. Avoid Selecting on the Dependent Variable

> Do not just study the outcome you want to understand.

Instead of concentrating on one group or issue, examine and compare multiple groups and outcomes. This broader approach provides a comprehensive understanding and prevents essential insights from being overlooked.

In conclusion, these techniques offer valuable insights for effectively utilizing data, making informed decisions, and avoiding common pitfalls in data analysis.
