Hi, I am Cozmina.

When I started working in sales, I didn't know exactly what I would be doing. I soon realized that selling was a means to what I truly enjoyed: helping customers solve business problems. Later, when I managed teams, I had the opportunity to help people to develop and grow. Although I have enjoyed my work at Vodafone, after 14 years, I felt trapped in my comfort zone, which worried me. So, I left the company without a clear plan for what I wanted to do next.

A new journey started, filled with challenges, acquiring new skills, and setting new goals. I learned a lot about myself and my direction. In 2023, after completing a graduate degree in strategic human resource management, which included coursework in organizational strategy, change management, empirical social research (qualitative and quantitative), and digital HR, I decided to transition to people analytics. I look forward to helping others make data-driven decisions.
