# About the blog

**Making Sense of Data** was created to help solving problems by using data to answer questions following an insight-oriented data approach rooted in the scientific method.

When I started this journey, I had to make several choices. One was to choose the software for analyzing data. Although I was familiar with Excel, I began considering whether to enhance my Excel skills or start learning a statistical program. Ultimately, I decided to learn R, a statistical program. The R community offers many open resources that significantly help my learning process. In addition, I wanted to document and share my work. And Quarto became the perfect tool for me to do this. I was able to create this space where I can share my learning and my work.

This blog is about my journey to make sense of data. It has two sections: one for storing and sharing projects, notes, and ideas, and another for sharing R and Quarto open resources I've gathered along the way. 
I hope you will find it useful, and feel free to share it with anyone!

With an extensive background in B2B sales and people management, I became interested in using data to answer questions during a masterâ€™s program in strategic human resource management at "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University, Iasi.

After completing a research project with qualitative data, I started working with quantitative data. This led me to initiate Making Sense of Data blog, focusing on turning data into meaningful insights. I am also passionate about open-source knowledge.
