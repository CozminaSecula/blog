Hi! I'm Cozmina.

A passionate about making sense of data with a focus on data analysis and visualization.

My work is the result of a combination of the following:

-   Over 17 years of experience in B2B direct sales, where I acted as a business partner and advisor, planning, analyzing, and implementing projects to achieve the desired results.

-   Knowledge of relational databases, SQL for data analysis, and the R programming language.

-   Continuous learning, curiosity, and growth mindset.
