# Introduction

Segmentation is an essential part of any analytics, helping to understand and derive insights from data. 

In this project, I used segmentation to understand compensation differences across various factors such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups through segmented employee data. 

This may help inform the development of a competitive compensation strategy. 

A competitive compensation strategy can help attract and retain top talent, improve employee morale and motivation, and ultimately drive business success.
