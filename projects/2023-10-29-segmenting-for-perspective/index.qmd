# Introduction

Segmentation is an essential part of people analytics, helping to understand and obtain insights from data.

In this project, I used segmentation to understand compensation differences across various factors such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups.

This may help inform the development of a competitive compensation strategy.

A competitive compensation strategy can help attract and retain top talent, improve employee morale and motivation, and ultimately drive business success.
