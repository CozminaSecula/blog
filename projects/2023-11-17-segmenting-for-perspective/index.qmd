# Project Description

## The Context

-   Imagine a company that offers a wide range of products and services. This inclusive and diverse company values representation across essential roles in its workforce, ensuring equal opportunities for all employees. However, their compensation strategy has not seen any significant changes or updates over the past three years.

-   The company aims to understand disparities in compensation, seeking insights based on factors such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups. This understanding will enable the company to address potential inequities and enhance its compensation strategy effectively.

-   How can the company employ data analytics to gain insights into compensation differences?

## Aim of this project

âœ… To understand compensation differences across various factors such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups through segmenting employee data.

-   This will help inform the development of a competitive compensation strategy.

-   A competitive compensation strategy can help attract and retain top talent, improve employee morale and motivation, and ultimately drive business success.

## Research Questions

-   How does compensation compare across different departments, roles, and experience levels?

-   Are there any disparities in compensation between different demographic groups that can be addressed?

## Data Collection

-   Data is sourced from the book : [The Fundamentals of People Analytics With Applications in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-28674-2)

-   The data set used in this project is **`employees`** and contains information on active and terminated employees, with a data dictionary available in the book.

## Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(peopleanalytics)
library(skimr)
library(DT)
library(ggtext)
library(cowplot) 
library(scales)
library(gtExtras)

```

## A glimpse at the data set

```{r}
data("employees")

peopleanalytics::employees|>
      DT::datatable((options = list(pageLength = 5)))
    
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
There are observations for 1470 employees and 36 variables.
:::

## Data summary

```{r}

employees|>
  skimr::skim()|>
  DT::datatable((options = list(pageLength = 5)))

```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   There are 8 categorical (qualitative) variables and 28 continuous (quantitative) variables.

-   No missing values for categorical variables. Continuous variables `yts_leads` and `ytd_sales` each have 1061 missing values.

-   The data are documented in a data dictionary available in the book.

# Analysis

To answer the research questions, a **descriptive analysis** will be performed to compare compensation differences across various factors such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups.

## 1. How does compensation compare across different departments, roles, and experience levels?

### Variables of interest

| Variable of interest | Variable Name (data set) | Description of Variable    | Data type   |

| Age                  | age                      | Employee age in years      | Continuous  |

### Data Preparation

#### Age

##### Define levels for generations

The generations are defined as follows:

| Generation Z | Millennial (Generation Y) | Generation X | Baby Boomers |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Ages 18-24   | Ages 25-40                | Ages 41-56   | Ages 57-60   |

    TRUE ~ "Age not in range"
  )

# Convert the 'generation' variable to a factor and specify the order of the levels

employees$generation <- factor(employees$generation, levels = generation_cohort)

# Summary

## 1. How does compensation compare across different departments, roles, and experience levels?

-   The average annual compensation across all departments is 137.180\$

-   Annual Compensation Intervals

    -   25.79% of the annual compensation falls between 62k-100k
    -   68.28% of the annual compensation falls between 100k-200k
    -   5.9% of the annual compensation falls between 200k-208k

-   Compensation by Department

    -   37% of employees (305) from R&D department earn between 150K-200k.
    -   37% of employees (130) from Sales department earn between 150k-200k.

-   Compensation by Role

    -   A significant number of Sales Executives (Sales) and Research Scientists (R&D) earn between 150K and 200K.
    -   The Sales Manager role has the highest average compensation, followed by the HR Manager for the manager role.
    -   The Vice President role has the lowest average compensation.

-   Compensation by Experience levels

    -   There are 323 employees with intermediate and junior levels of experience who earn salaries ranging from 150K to 200K.
    -   In contrast, 125 employees with experienced, expert, and senior levels of experience earn in the same range.
    -   Senior level of experience in the Sales department has the highest average compensation.
    -   The Expert level of experience in the HR department has the lowest average.

-   Last Salary Increase

    -   **By Department**: A majority of employees (at least 61%) from all departments received a salary increase between 11% and 15%.
    -   Specifically, the Sales department had the highest percentage of employees receiving this range of salary increase, at 64.41%.
    -   The Human Resources department had the lowest percentage of employees receiving a salary increase of 15%-20%, at 21.57%.
    -   **By Role**: Over 54% of employees across all roles received a salary increase between 11%-15% for their most recent compensation adjustment.
    -   **By Experience Level**: As the experience level increases, the percentage of employees receiving a salary increase of 15% or more, decreases.
    -   In particular, the highest percentage of employees who received a salary increase between 15%-25% is at the Junior level, while the Senior level has the lowest percentage.

## 2. Are there any disparities in compensation between different demographic groups that can be addressed?

-   Compensation By Generations

    -   The majority of employees fall into the millennial generation and earn between 150k-200k.
    -   This is followed by Generation X, with most employees also earning within the same range.
    -   The smallest representation comes from Generation Z and Baby Boomers, who mainly earn between 100k-200k.
    -   The Baby Boomers group from the HR has the lowest average compensation, followed by the Generation Z group from the Sales department.

-   Compensation By Gender

    -   There is a gender disparity in the number of employees across different compensation levels in the company.
    -   Women from the HR department have the lowest average compensation compared with men within the same department and women from the other departments.

# Conclusion

In this project, I aimed to analyze compensation differences based on variables such as roles, departments, experience, and demographic groups. By analyzing employee data, companies can identify learning opportunities backed by evidence. This information can then be used to develop a more competitive compensation strategy, which can have various benefits, such as attracting and retaining high-performing employees, boosting employee morale and motivation, and ultimately contributing to the success of the business.
