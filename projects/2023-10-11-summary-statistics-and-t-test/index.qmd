# Introduction

In the [previous analysis](https://cozminasecula.github.io/blog/projects/2023-09-14-frequency-tables-and-chi-squared-test/), I introduced you to the fundamental concept of using frequency tables and the chi-squared test to analyze categorical data.

Building on that foundation, this post goes one step further by offering two tools for data analysis, which will work with both continuous and categorical data: summary statistics and the independent samples t-test.

Summary statistics is a part of descriptive statistics serving as a powerful means to extract valuable insights from a data set. It may include essential metrics such as the total number of values, the mean value, and the standard deviation. These statistics provide a clear picture of data trends and distribution, aiding in the interpretation of data patterns.On the other hand, the independent-samples t-test is employed to compare means between two distinct groups of data.It helps us investigate whether these two groups differ significantly in a particular dimension. When employed together, these tools can unveil intriguing patterns and relationships within data.

The presentation will guide you through the utilization of summary statistics and the independent-samples t-test for insightful data analysis.
