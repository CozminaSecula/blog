# Introduction

In the [previous post](https://cozminasecula.github.io/blog/projects/2023-09-14-frequency-tables-and-chi-squared-test/), I introduced two fundamental concepts to analyze categorical data: frequency tables and the chi-squared test.

This post goes one step further by offering two tools for data analysis, which will work with continuous and categorical data: summary statistics and the independent samples t-test.

As part of descriptive statistics, summary statistics can provide valuable insights into data sets. It may include essential metrics such as the total number of values, the mean value, and the standard deviation. These statistics provide a clear picture of data trends and distribution, aiding in the interpretation of data patterns. On the other hand, the independent-samples t-test (part of inferential statistics) is employed to compare means between two distinct groups. It helps us investigate whether these two groups differ significantly in a particular dimension. When used together, these tools can reveal intriguing patterns and relationships within data.

The presentation will guide you through the utilization of summary statistics and the independent-samples t-test for insightful data analysis.
